## Currently Running
![Me standing outside the MIT Media Lab](media/me-at-MIT.jpg)

I just wrapped up an internship last week with the Fluid Interfaces group at MIT Media Lab. I can't say too much about what I did yet (think robotics and HCI) as I'm still working on the project remotely. Overall, I had a fantastic time at MIT and in Boston and hope to be back soon.

While I'm beginning to onboard new people who will work on the aforementioned project, I'm starting to shift back into school mode. I'm specifically ramping back up for classes, clubs (not sure if I'm doing two engineering clubs this year – we'll see), and...grad school applications. It's a very dynamic time in my life and I'm returning back to California with a lot of gratitude for the past and excitement about the future.

## Background Services
I'm (very slowly) finishing up the 3D-printable housing for a personal project – which I've now deemed Haystack – I put on pause as school picked up.

The basic problem that made me want to build Haystack is that when my room gets messy, I tend to have a singular pile of clothing in one location. I'd like to be able to find a piece of clothing in it based on color and clothing type descriptors. This is going to involve things like stereo vision, video segmentation and object recognition, and online learning, which I'm excited to dive into once I finish designing the housing for the Jetson and cameras.

### Small purchases
- Have you ever been playing music aloud on a speaker and then your favorite part of your favorite song gets interrupted by...a Discord notification? [SoundSource solves this](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) by allowing you to route certain sounds to your speaker and other sounds to your computer.
- After some internal reflection and talking to friends, I've noticed that I simply do not retain notes that I take on my iPad well (if at all). To mark my shift away from digital notetaking, I got [this Muji notebook/binder hybrid](https://www.muji.us/collections/paper-goods/products/loose-leaf-papers-kraft-binder-naba0s?variant=40606680809662) that has brought me so much joy.
### Tweets
This was fun to go down a rabbit hole to understand after.

...I'm really not sure how to feel about this particular robot.

Stay tuned to see if I stick to this set of subtitles next month!
