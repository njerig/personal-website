Hi, I'm Njeri.

I'm working on autonomous vehicle engineering and safety with Cruz Control and AIEA, and building electric vehicle dashboards with Formula Slug. Last summer I worked in the [UCLA Biomechatronics Lab](https://biomechatronics.ucla.edu/) (supported by Amazon) on a robotics project for potential use at the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and this summer I'll be working in the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab on a project integrating augmented reality with brain-computer interfaces.

I'm especially drawn to projects that blend hardware and software, including in robotics, next-generation computing systems, embedded systems, and sensors. I also enjoy teaching computer science, mathematics, and physics.

Here's where you can find me elsewhere on the web.
