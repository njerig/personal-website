Hi, I'm Njeri.

I'm a senior at UC Santa Cruz studying Computer Science (with a minor in Computer Engineering). I work on autonomous vehicle engineering and safety with Cruz Control and AIEA, and building electric vehicle dashboards with Formula Slug. 

## Other recent work
Last summer I worked in the [UCLA Biomechatronics Lab](https://biomechatronics.ucla.edu/) on a robotics project for potential use at the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This summer I began working in the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab on a project examining human relationships with digital and robotic entities.

## Interests
In general, I'm most drawn to the engineering of adaptive, context-aware systems like robots and next-generation computing interfaces enabled by AR devices and BCIs. I love working horizontally across the hardware, software, and mechanical domains. I also enjoy teaching computer science, mathematics, and physics.
